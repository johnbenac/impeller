## Key Performance Metrics

### Efficiency Statistics
- Maximum Efficiency: 73.0%
- Average Efficiency: 72.6%
- Efficiency Range: 51.3% - 73.0%

### Operating Ranges
1. **Optimal Range (15-30 m/s)**:
   - Consistent 73% efficiency
   - Stable performance
   - Perfect convergence

2. **Challenging Points**:
   - 35 m/s: Efficiency drop to 51.3%
   - 5 m/s: Residual error of 2.0528

3. **Recovery Range (40 m/s)**:
   - Return to 73% efficiency
   - Stable operation
   - Good convergence

## Recommendations Based on Visualizations

1. **Operating Range**:
   - Primary operation: 15-30 m/s
   - Avoid sustained operation at 35 m/s
   - Use caution below 10 m/s

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Focus improvements on low flow rates
   - Investigate 35 m/s efficiency drop
   - Consider additional test points in optimal range

3. **Design Considerations**:
   - Maintain current blade configuration for 15-30 m/s
   - Consider geometry modifications for low flow stability
   - Investigate blade loading at 35 m/s
