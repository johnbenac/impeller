# Impeller Performance Visualization Summary

## Generated Visualizations

### 1. Efficiency vs Flow Rate Plot (`efficiency_flow_plot.png`)
- Shows the relationship between flow rate and efficiency
- Points are colored by test case category (Low, Medium, High flow rates)
- Includes trend line to show overall efficiency pattern
- Highlights the efficiency drop at 35 m/s

### 2. Convergence Plot (`convergence_plot.png`)
- Displays optimization improvement for each flow rate
- Separate lines for each test case
- Shows how quickly each case converged to optimal solution
- Helps identify challenging operating points

### 3. Performance Heatmap (`performance_heatmap.png`)
- 2D visualization of performance density
- Bright regions indicate optimal operating conditions
- Red points show actual test points
- Helps identify stable operating regions

### 4. Interactive Analysis (`interactive_analysis.html`)
Interactive dashboard with four panels:
1. **Efficiency vs Flow Rate**: Dynamic plot with hover information
2. **Optimization Improvement**: Shows convergence patterns
3. **Error Distribution**: Histogram of optimization errors
4. **Performance Overview**: Bar chart of average efficiency by case

## Key Visualization Insights

1. **Operating Range Performance**:
   - Clear efficiency plateau in medium flow range (15-30 m/s)
   - Sharp efficiency drop at 35 m/s
   - Recovery of efficiency at 40 m/s

2. **Optimization Effectiveness**:
   - Most test points achieved perfect convergence
   - Low flow rates show some residual error
   - High flow rates demonstrate stable convergence

3. **Performance Stability**:
   - Most stable performance in medium flow range
   - Higher variability at flow extremes
   - Clear optimal operating band identified
